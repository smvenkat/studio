# **App Name**: API Pilot

## Core Features:

- API Definition Upload: Accepts Swagger JSON or YAML file as input and validates it.
- Smart Test Plan Generation: AI powered tool analyzes the swagger file and recommends the possible performance testing types like Stress, Load, Soak, Spike with SLI/SLO metrics.
- Environment Selection: Lets the user choose the testing environment based on stages of API life cycle and it automatically suggests appropriate performance testing types
- Script Generation: The tool transforms API definition and the smart testing plans to generate and configure K6 test scripts dynamically.
- Test Configuration: Configure test execution with number of virtual users, iterations, and other relevant performance parameters.
- Real-time Reporting: Real-time monitoring and visualization of test execution results with metrics and graphs.
- Artifact Archiving: Enables the downloads of generated scripts and execution reports as a zip file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to reflect stability and performance.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Vibrant green (#34A853) to highlight key metrics and actions.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean, modern, and readable interface; suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use a set of consistent icons representing performance metrics and actions.
- Grid-based layout with clear separation of sections for API definition, test configuration, and reports.
- Subtle animations during test execution and when displaying performance reports.
